Char kway teow, literally "stir-fried ricecake strips", is a popular noodle dish in Malaysia,
 Singapore, Brunei and Indonesia.[1] The dish is considered a national favourite in Malaysia and Singapore.
It is made from flat rice noodles (Chinese: ??; pinyin: hé fen; Cantonese Yale: hó fán) or
 kway teow (Chinese: ??; pinyin: guo tiáo; Cantonese Yale: gwó tìu) of approximately 1 cm or
 (in the north of Malaysia) about 0.5 cm in width, stir-fried over very high heat with light 
and dark soy sauce, chilli, a small quantity of belachan, whole prawns, deshelled blood cockles,
 bean sprouts and chopped Chinese chives. The dish is commonly stir-fried with egg, slices of Chinese
 sausage, fishcake, beansprouts, and less commonly with other ingredients.[2]
