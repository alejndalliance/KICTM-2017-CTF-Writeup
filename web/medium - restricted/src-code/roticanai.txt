Roti canai (pronunciation t?anai) or roti cane (pronunciation t?ane) is a type of Indian-influenced 
flatbread found in Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia and Singapore. It is often sold in Mamak stalls in 
Malaysia; also in Malay, Minangkabau and Aceh restaurants in Indonesia. It is known as roti prata in 
Southern Malaysia and Singapore, and is similar to the Indian Kerala porotta. It is also found 
throughout Thailand, where it is called "Ro Tee" and is typically sold by Muslims, most often from 
street carts, and is usually Halal.
In English and in Chinese, roti canai is sometimes referred to as "flying bread" (?? feibing), a 
term that evokes the process of tossing and spinning by which it is made. In Chinese, Roti canai is 
originally called ???? "yìn dù jian bing", which means Indian pancake.
